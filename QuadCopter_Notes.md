# Notes
- Two motors must turn clockwise and two motors must turn counter-clockwise

- (Motors are numbered according to position on graph)

# Instructions for acending and decending
- Increase or decrease the rpm of all four motors

# Instructions for turning right and left
- Increase the rpm of two of the four motors who are positioned in the direction you want to go
  (For example to go right increase the rpm of the motors on the right side)

# Topics to research 
- how to receive radio controlled(RC) signals using Arduino
- what are the best lightweight yet powerfull motors to use for quadcopter
- lightweight, yet strong battery
- how to install and use a motor shield
 (will most likely need two because each motor sheild can only support two motors )
- how to stabilize the aircraft so it can hover at a certain height
- light weight, yet sturdy framework
- some sort of tiny camera to mount ontop aircraft
- a way to mesure battery percentage
