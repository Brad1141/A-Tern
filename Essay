-with this being said the message of the passages is not one of hostility towards religious instatutions but rather what they symbolize in
the passage which could be a strutured and ordered society.

Irony is used in stories "Araby" by James Joyce and "A&P" by John Updike to demonstrate to the reader that most of the time fighting 
for a just cause can lead to serious consequences. Then reviewing the conclusions for "Araby" and "A&P" one can see that the
outcomes were not what the main character was hoping for planned by the reader. For example in the story "Araby" the main characer is seen
crying at the end of the story beacuse of his faliure to buy his friend's sister a gift. Also the narrator of "Araby" describes the 
outcome of the event at the store as "The sad part of the story". In both these cases one can assume that the outcome was not desired as
the narrators reflect over the conclusion with a somber tone. One could also say that the conclusion was quite ironic as the passages did
not followed the "Hero's Journey", which usually has the main character achieving his goal. However this is not present in "Araby" where 
the boy fails and in "A&P" the main character does help the 3 girls but loses his job in the process and also recieves no thanks or
gratitude from the people that he helped. With this is mind the message of the passages could be that in reality things do not always
work out as planned. By using similar ironic twist the messages of both JamesJoyce and John Updike turn out to be more similar then
at first glance. They both attempt to sway the reader to have realistic expections and not fanatical ones by using ironic plot twist.
As a result both short stories are very similar in their use of irony to convey a message to their audiences.
